ArcFace is a state of the art deep learning model used for Face Recognition. This model utilizes contrastive loss in the cross entropy loss function to group embeddings of the same class closer together. The utilzation of a margin penalty maximizes separation of the ground truth class and produces a larger correction to the ground truth, resulting in an effective separation of class decision boundaries.
